# TODO
======

This project is extremely early in development.  Below is a summary of tasks required before the first alpha release.

- implement a high-level "experiment" class to tie everything together (design still needs fleshed out)
- add unit tests for each class/function
- add sample data sets with example code
- add detailed doc strings for each class/function
- add project documentation and usage examples
- re-factor visualization functions to have a cleaner API
- update seaborn calls to use the 0.6 APIs
- update ensemble functions with proper imports and remove hard-coded dependencies
- create emsemble classes and make the design more flexible than current functions
- finish the "AllLabelEncoder" class
- finish the "FactorToNumeric" class
- extend support for loading and saving models to handle a much wider variety of use cases
- incorporate model definition, training, cross-validation, and parameter search from origin kaggle scripts
- extend parameter search capabilities to be flexible and use random search where possible
- add optional extensions/dependencies for additional libraries
